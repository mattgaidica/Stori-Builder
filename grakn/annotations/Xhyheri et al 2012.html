<h2 class='title'>Heart Rate Variability Today - Analysis of HRV</h2>

<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>underline [page 321]: </span>Heart Rate Variability Today</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>underline [page 321]: </span>Borejda Xhyheri</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 321]: </span>During the past 30 years, an increasing number of studies have related the imbalance of the autonomic nervous system (as assessed by HRV) to several pathophysiogical conditions, particularly in the setting of cardiovascular disease.</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 321]: </span>“A balance that does not tremble cannot weigh, A man who does not oscillate is a dead one” Erwin Chargaff</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 321]: </span>A wide spectrum of other pathophysiological conditions are inﬂuenced by an imbalance in autonomic activity, including atherosclerothic plaque progression, congestive heart failure, diabetic neuropathy, susceptibility to sudden death in infancy and psychiatric disorders such as depression.</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 321]: </span>The autonomic nervous system regulates visceral functions through the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches which act antagonistically to preserve a dynamic equilibrium of vital functions.</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 321]: </span>In the cardiovascular system this nonstationary balance results in the ﬂuctuation between intervals of consecutive heart beats, so called heart rate variability (HRV).</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 321]: </span>Impaired autonomic activity has been shown to be an independent predictor of mortality after myocardial infarction. 1–6</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 321]: </span>HRV measures were divided into two broad categories: time domain and frequency domain measures. 7</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 321]: </span>The rule of thumb is that data obtained from short-term (5 minutes) recordings should be processed with frequency-domain methods, whereas time-domain analyses should be performed to analyze</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class='title'>Heart Rate Variability Today - Time-domain methods</h2>

<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 322]: </span>as the HRV reﬂects the activity of the autonomic nervous system on the sinus node, abnormal heart beats and artefacts should be excluded from electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings to achieve more reliable results.</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 322]: </span>Time domain methods in a continuous ECG recording permit determination of either instant heart rate or intervals between successive normal QRS complexes (normal-tonormal R-R interval, NN) and other variables derived from NN intervals</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 322]: </span>SDNN is a marker of the total power (variance) of HRV and reﬂects all long-term components responsible for variability in the recording period, including circadian rhythm and physical activity.</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 322]: </span>Since the total variance of HRV is directly related to the length of analyzed recording 8 it is misleading to compare SDNN measures obtained from ECG strips of different durations.</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 322]: </span>HRV analysis in ECG recordings shorter or longer than 24 hours may be estimated by dividing the long-term ECG Holter monitor into 5-minute segments</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class='title'>Heart Rate Variability Today - Implications of abnormal HRV parameters</h2>

<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 323]: </span>Short-term recordings of HRV distinguish two main spectral components: a high-frequency (HF) component (ranging between 0.15-0.40 Hz), and a low-frequency (LF) component (ranging between 0.04-0.15 Hz), respectively considered markers of parasympathetic and sympathetic control (Table 2).</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 323]: </span>Frequency domain methods are used to study heart rate variations by breaking the heart rate signal into its constituents (frequencies) and quantifying their relative intensity (power).</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 323]: </span>High frequency (HF), from 0.15 to 0.4 Hz: a marker of the parasympathetic tone</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 323]: </span>Low frequency (LF), from 0.04 to 0.15 Hz: possibly correlated to sympathetic tone or to autonomic balance</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 323]: </span>LF/HF ratio: index of the interaction between sympathetic and vagal activity</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 323]: </span>A ratio between LF and HF is used to assess the fractional distribution between the two systems and is an important marker of sympathovagal balance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class='title'>Heart Rate Variability Today - HRV and diabetes</h2>

<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 324]: </span>Overall, low HRV values usually indicate a relative sympathetic dominance, which may be due to high sympathetic activity and/or low parasympathetic activity. On the other hand, high HRV values indicate a shift of the sympathetic/parasympathetic balance toward increased vagal activity.</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 324]: </span>In middle-age subjects, HRV follows a periodic circadian pattern (cosine function).</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 324]: </span>LF/HF and heart rate can be used as markers of more sympathetic modulation and show an opposite behaviour, reaching the peak in the afternoon (02:00-04:00 PM), then decreasing until the ﬁrst hours after midnight. 15</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 324]: </span>In a population between 20 and 70 years old, 24hour Holter recordings revealed a age-related decrease of all parameters, especially of parasympathetic cardiac activity due to aging. 19</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 324]: </span>HRV is signiﬁcantly lower in healthy women compared with healthy men. 19,22 This ﬁnding may be explained by a lower sympathetic activity, which can be ascribed in the well documented pathophysiological gender related differences among women and men. 23–31</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 324]: </span>A low HRV may provide protection against arrhythmias and against the early development of coronary heart disease.</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 324]: </span>Young African Americans already have a lower parasympathetic activity than do comparable-aged Caucasian Americans, which, in turn, suggests that young African American individuals might show signs of premature aging in their autonomic nervous system. 32</p>

<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 325]: </span>Loss of weight contributes to restoration of autonomic function. 55 Likewise, in patients with metabolic syndrome, all HRV parameters measured are reduced. 54</p>
