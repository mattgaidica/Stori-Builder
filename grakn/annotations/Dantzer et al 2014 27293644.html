<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>underline [page 1]: </span>Measures of physiological stress: a transparent or opaque window into the status, management and conservation of species?</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>underline [page 1]: </span>Ben Dantzer</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 2]: </span>Glucocorticoids are fundamental to how animals integrate, cope with and respond to both predictable and unpredictable perturbations in their environment, and they are closely tied to individual performance and fitness, and perhaps to population dynamics</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 2]: </span>Physiological stress is frequently described as the group of adaptive physiological responses (‘general adaptation syndrome’; Seyle, 1936) to an aversive extrinsic stimulus (a ‘stressor’) that helps to restore internal homeostasis (Cannon, 1932) following exposure to the aversive stimulus.</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 2]: </span>it is important to remember that the homeostatic set points that the stress response is trying to restore can change seasonally or according to life history stage, and with other intrinsic (e.g. age, body condition, reproductive status) or extrinsic factors (e.g. weather, predation risk).</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 2]: </span>McEwen and Wingfield (2003) introduced the concept of allostasis or ‘maintaining constancy through change’ to physiological ecology. Allostasis describes the range of predictive and responsive physiological processes that assist in the maintenance of homeostasis and explicitly recognizes that homeostatic set points are not fixed and that organisms have evolved physiological mechanisms that enable them to maintain some degree of internal constancy in the face of a variable environment</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 2]: </span>Here, we define physiological stress as the multidimensional physiological response to predictable and unpredictable environmental stimuli (stressors) that challenge internal stability or homeostasis, though we recognize that these homeostatic set points can fluctuate.</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 2]: </span>The vertebrate neuroendocrine response is facilitated largely by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis; in birds and mammals) or hypothalamic–pituitary–inter-renal axis (HPI axis; in amphibians, fish and reptiles)</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>underline [page 2]: </span>hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>underline [page 2]: </span>hypothalamic–pituitary–inter-renal axis (HPI axis</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 3]: </span>conservation physiologists are, for the most part, interested in sustained or chronic increases in physiological stress. These chronic increases in glucocorticoid levels are thought to inhibit reproduction and may also reduce survivorship (Sapolsky et al., 2000), though the evidence for this in free-living animals is inconsistent</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 3]: </span>Chronic stress has traditionally been thought to represent a dysregulation of the HPA or HPI axis (Sapolsky et al., 1986) or allostatic (McEwen and Wingfield, 2003) or homeostatic overload (Romero et al., 2009) that is brought on by chronic exposure to unpredictable or uncontrollable environmental challenges.</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 3]: </span>This dysregulation of the HPA or HPI axis is primarily caused by a loss of negative feedback, in which chronic stress decreases the number of glucocorticoid receptors in key regulatory parts of the brain, such as the hippocampus and hypothalamus</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 3]: </span>Glucocorticoid levels are frequently used to quantify physiological or chronic stress (Sapolsky et al., 2000), and there are a number of sources from which glucocorticoids can be measured in free-living animals, namely from blood (plasma or serum), saliva, faeces, urine, hair or feathers</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 3]: </span>There are also a number of downstream measures (e.g. glucose, free fatty acids, body mass, telomere length, oxidative stress) that can be used as biomarkers of chronic stress.</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 3]: </span>Individuals under chronic stress can exhibit elevated baseline blood glucocorticoids, a stronger increase in blood glucocorticoids in response to some environmental challenge or a reduced ability to terminate the stress response</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 3]: </span>Baseline glucocorticoid levels can be measured by obtaining blood samples within ~3 min of initial capture</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>underline [page 4]: </span>Faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM)</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 4]: </span>Faecal glucocorticoid metabolites reflect free (unbound to corticosteroid-binding globulin) plasma glucocorticoid levels (Sheriff et al., 2010) that an individual has experienced over a species-specific amount of time</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 5]: </span>Free fatty acids and haematocrit levels in free-living animals have been observed to decrease in environments where individuals were presumed to be under chronic stress</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 5]: </span>Immune responses are predicted to decline under chronic stress (Sapolsky et al., 2000; Dhabhar, 2009; Martin, 2009), and this has been observed in a number of studies in free-living animals that have used relatively simple measures of immune function, such as counts of leukocytes and lymphocytes</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 5]: </span>Chronic stress is also thought to inhibit reproduction</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 5]: </span>Body mass is also predicted to decline under chronic stress, and interestingly, it is a consistent biomarker of chronic stress</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 7]: </span>plasma glucocorticoid levels increase with age in some humans, but decrease with age in others (Lupien et al., 1995, 1998). This highlights that there is among-individual phenotypic plasticity (Nussey et al., 2007) in the effects of age on glucocorticoid levels.</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 10]: </span>chronic stress can cause neuronal atrophy in key parts of the brain (Sapolsky, 1996), suppress the immune system (Dhabhar and McEwen, 1997; Korte et al., 2005) and inhibit reproduction</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 10]: </span>chronic elevations in glucocorticoid levels in free-living animals or those exposed to real ecological challenges can trigger adaptive phenotypic plasticity that enables animals to cope better with that environment</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 10]: </span>the ‘cortfitness hypothesis’ predicts that as the number of challenges individuals experience increases, baseline glucocorticoid levels increase and fitness decreases</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 10]: </span>Bonier et al. (2009) found inconsistent relationships between plasma glucocorticoids and fitness.</p>


<p class='item'><span class='annotationRef'>highlight [page 12]: </span>Now I believe that the scattered state of ecology, which is like an active worm that has been chopped into little bits, each admirably brisk, but leading a rather exclusive and lonely existence, and not combining to get anywhere in particular, this disintegrating tendency, in what should be a coherent and united organism, is very largely due to a lack of proper working hypotheses.
