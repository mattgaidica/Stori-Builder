a = s.annotations.create :body => " In the frequency domain, it was commented that spontaneous EEG and the EPs have common frequency bands, and, upon stimulation, spectral regularization of the EEG occurs."

a = s.annotations.create :body => "Research has shown several generators of delta oscillations in human brain. Long-lasting hyperpolarizations generated by pyramidal neurons yield EEG delta oscillations (Steriade, 1993; Steriade and Buzsaki, 1990; Steriade et al., 1990)."

s = Source.create :title => "Optogenetic Stimulation of Frontal D1 Neurons Compensates for Impaired Temporal Control of Action in Dopamine-Depleted Mice"

s.annotations.create :body => "Blocking D1- but not D2-type dopamine receptors impairs temporal processing and neuronal activity correlated with temporal control in rodents [11, 13, 14], paralleling work in primates and humans implicating frontal D1-dopamine receptors (D1DRs) in cognitive processing [15, 16]."

s.annotations.create :body => "Ramping neurons can be strongly functionally coupled with delta rhythms (1–4 Hz), which are influenced by focal MFC D1DR agonists and antagonists [13, 18]. These data lead to the hypothesis that D1DR-dependent MFC delta rhythms critically regulate temporal processing."
